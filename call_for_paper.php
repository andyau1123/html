            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">In the face of escalating environmental challenges, the integration of waste management and circular economy principles, particularly in the context of climate change, is becoming increasingly crucial for sustainable development. This Special Issue invites pioneering research that explores the synergies between waste management, circular economy practices, and climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. Our goal is to highlight innovative approaches that not only reduce waste and promote resource efficiency but also contribute to climate change resilience in various sectors.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">We are particularly interested in submissions that demonstrate how waste management and circular economy initiatives can be designed or reimagined to address the multifaceted impacts of climate change, thereby contributing to the sustainability of ecosystems, economies, and communities.</p>

			<div>
				<p><b>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Innovative waste reduction, recycling, and valorization strategies within the circular economy that mitigate climate change impacts.</li>
					<li>The role of waste management in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration.</li>
					<li>Circular economy solutions that improve resilience to climate change across supply chains and communities.</li>
					<li>Assessments of climate risks and vulnerabilities in waste management systems and circular economy practices.</li>
					<li>Policy, regulatory, and financial frameworks that support the integration of waste management, circular economy principles, and climate change goals.</li>
					<li>Case studies on the successful implementation of integrated waste management and circular economy projects with a focus on climate change adaptation and mitigation.</li>
					<li>Technological innovations that facilitate the transition to circular economy models while addressing climate change.</li>
				</ul>
